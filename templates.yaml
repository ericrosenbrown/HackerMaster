correct: You are correct! You've hacked {{secure_passphrase[0]}} percent of the mainframe. Your next pass phrase is {{ secure_passphrase[1] }} {{ secure_passphrase[2] }} is in {{ secure_passphrase[3] }}

wrong: That was the wrong phrase, {{ secure_passphrase[0] }} more errors until system boot. Here is the pass phrase again. The {{ secure_passphrase[1] }} {{ secure_passphrase[2] }} is in {{ secure_passphrase[3] }}.

win: The mainframe is hacked, good job. Would you like to hack another system?

set_secure_passphrase: Here is your pass phrase. The {{ secure_passphrase[0] }} {{ secure_passphrase[1] }} is in {{ secure_passphrase[2] }}.

lose: Your V P N has been taken down, you have been booted from the system. Would you like to try again?

answer_with_no_question: You're not currently hacking anything. Would you like to start a hack?
